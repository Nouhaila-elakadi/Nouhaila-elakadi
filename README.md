- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nouhaila-elakadi
- 👀 I’m interested in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Embedded Systems, and standards like ISO 26262 and AUTOSAR.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the integration of ADAS technologies with AUTOSAR and ISO 26262, as well as object detection on the road (e.g., vehicle, pedestrian, and lane detection) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to ADAS development, embedded system safety.
